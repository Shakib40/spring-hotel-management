1. Java Fundamentals (Pre-requisite)
Before diving deep into Spring Boot:
OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
Collections (List, Set, Map)
Streams & Lambdas
Exception Handling
Generics
Multithreading Basics
Java 8+ Features (Optional, Streams, Optional, LocalDate, etc.)


2. Spring Boot Basics
What is Monolith vs Microservices
Spring Boot Starter dependencies
application.properties vs application.yml
Profiles: dev, test, prod
Application lifecycle (@SpringBootApplication, beans initialization)
Dependency Injection: Constructor vs Field vs Setter injection


3. REST API Development
@RestController, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.
Path variables vs request params
Request body vs response body
DTOs for requests & responses
Validation (javax.validation → @NotNull, @Size, etc.)
Global Exception Handling with @ControllerAdvice


4. Database & Persistence Layer
JPA & Hibernate Basics
Entities & Relationships:
One-to-One
One-to-Many / Many-to-One
Many-to-Many (join tables)
Lazy vs Eager fetching
Cascading operations
CRUD with JpaRepository
Custom queries with @Query (JPQL & native SQL)
Paging & Sorting (Pageable)
Transactions (@Transactional)

5. Business Logic Layer
Service Layer with @Service
Mapping Entities ↔ DTOs (manual or MapStruct)
Utility classes for clean code
Proper layering (Controller → Service → Repository)

6. Security
Spring Security basics
Authentication & Authorization
Password encoding (BCryptPasswordEncoder)
JWT (JSON Web Token) auth flow
Role-based access control (@PreAuthorize, @RolesAllowed)
Securing REST APIs (endpoints by roles)
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

7. Communication
Send Emails (JavaMailSender, HTML templates)
Send SMS (Twilio, Nexmo, or any provider API)
File upload/download endpoints (MultipartFile)
REST API integration (RestTemplate, WebClient)

8. Utility Features
Logging with SLF4J & Logback
Centralized error response structure (custom ApiError object)
Scheduled tasks (@Scheduled)
Async methods (@Async)
Application Events (ApplicationEventPublisher)
File-based configurations (@ConfigurationProperties)

9. Testing
JUnit 5 basics
Unit tests with Mockito
Integration tests with @SpringBootTest
MockMvc for controller testing
Testcontainers (for DB integration tests)

10. Performance & Scaling (Still Monolith)
Caching (@Cacheable, @CacheEvict)
Hibernate second-level cache (EhCache/Redis)
Connection Pooling (HikariCP configs)
Profiling & monitoring (Actuator)

11. DevOps & Deployment
Build with Maven/Gradle (mvn clean install)
Fat JAR (java -jar app.jar)
External DB connection configs (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
Deploy to:
On-premise server
Docker container
Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, Render, Railway, etc.)

12. Production-Grade Concerns
Exception & error handling standards (custom error responses)
Input validation everywhere
Logging best practices (structured logs, log rotation)
Monitoring with Spring Boot Actuator
Health checks (/actuator/health)
Graceful shutdown
API versioning


13. Advanced Topics (Optional but Valuable)
Even in monoliths, these are handy:
Internationalization (i18n) → multilingual support
Multi-tenancy (one app, multiple customers with separate DBs)
Liquibase / Flyway for DB migrations
GraphQL with Spring Boot
WebSockets (real-time chat/notifications)
Event-driven design (using Spring Events internally)
